I believe it is possible to build a Information app for RPI community. Currently most of the posts (for clubs, sales, etc..) are posted at doors/notification boards on somec certain buildings(inlcuding commons dining halls, Johnsson Engineering center, etc..) The draw back of this form is some students away from campus may not see these adds, and students who see the notification board may not efficently get the info they need. By building this app, all students in RPI community will have access to the info they need with high efficency. It will be a blessed repository. Everyone may commit their improvement to the repository, but all commitments will be reviewd before being merged.
